        You are evaluating a database Q&A agent. Given the question, the SQL query result data, and the agent's response, determine whether the agent correctly answered the question.

        Question:
        
        ```
        {{$.test_case.input.question}}
        ```

        SQL Query Result:
        
        ```
        {{$.output.value.query_result}}
        ```
        
        Agent Response:
        
        ```
        {{$.output.value.response}}
        ```

        Did the agent correctly answer the question based on the data?
